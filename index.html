		<p id="page"> Dwyane Wade to Chicago </p>
		<p> After 13 years as the unquestioned face of the Miami Heat franchise, Dwyane Wade is no longer among the select few who call themeselves Heat Lifers. The man formerly adorned with the nickname Flash, bolted his way up to Chicago this past summer after messy negotiations in Miami fractured what was once an admirable relationship with the Heat ownership. This news came on the heels of Kevin Durnat's departure to Golden State, furthering the shocked state that the NBA was already in. </p>

		<p> To most in the NBA, this news came as quite a shock, but those close to Wade are not all that surprised, stating that he has long expressed a desire to return home and play basketball in these red and black Chicago uniforms that Michael Jordan once made so famous. However, what everyone, including those close to him, have wondered, is how would he fit in with this Bulls team. The NBA has gradually become a league obsessed with 3-pointers and the space that they create, and with Wade, Rondo, and Butler in the backcourt, many do not expect the team to be in a vast supply of either. </p>

		<p> Wade's scorching start from 3-point land has silenced some critics, but many experts seem to think his percentage will be brought back down to earth as the season progresses. However, one thing so far seems very certain; The Bulls are a good team, and Dwyane Wade is a very big reason for that. Things like this tend to happen when you add one of the best to ever tie them up to your squad. </p>
